# Contributing to ScootLease

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ScootLease! It's people like you that make ScootLease such a great tool.

## Getting Started

- Fork the project.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
- Navigate into the project directory: `cd scootlease`
- Install the dependencies: `composer install`
- Create a new branch for each feature, improvement or bugfix.

## Code Contributions

Here are a few important things you should know about contributing code:

1. **Open an Issue**: Before you start your work, make sure there isn't an existing issue related to your work. If there isn't one, open a new issue to describe your proposed changes. This allows others to provide feedback and prevents multiple people from working on the same issue.

2. **Branching**: The `main` branch is where the stable version of the project lives, so any work you do should be done in a separate branch. This allows you to work without interrupting the live production version of the project.

3. **Clean Code**: Ensure your code is readable and clean, to help others understand it. Make sure to comment your code when necessary.

4. **Pull Requests**: When you're finished with your work, create a pull request. In the pull request description, explain the changes you made, why you made them, and any implications they might have. Include any relevant issue numbers.

5. **Code Reviews**: After you submit a pull request, expect feedback and requests for changes. Don't take feedback as criticism! They're intended to improve your code and help you become a better developer.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked through GitHub issues. Before creating a new issue, do a quick search to see if the problem has been reported already. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

When creating a new issue, provide a descriptive title and a clear description. Include as much relevant information as possible, such as the version of the software, your operating system, and steps to reproduce the bug.

## Final Thoughts

Remember, the goal is to create a quality product, and your contributions are helping to achieve that. Thank you for your work and dedication to ScootLease!
